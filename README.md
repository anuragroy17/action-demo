## Setting Up Secrets
In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add the following secrets:

**FILE_URL:** The URL from where the ZIP file should be downloaded.
**GITHUB_TOKEN:** A GitHub token with permissions to create branches and pull requests.

## Explanation

*Python Script:*

- Downloads a ZIP file from a specified URL. The filename is inferred from the Content-Disposition header if available.
- Unzips the downloaded file.
- Checks for differences only if the file names in the extracted directory and repository match.
- Adds new files directly if they do not exist in the repository or if the names do not match.
- Raises a pull request if there are differences or new files.

*GitHub Actions Workflow:*

- Runs the Python script on a schedule or manually.
- Uses secrets to securely pass sensitive information to the script.

This setup ensures that only files with matching names are compared, and new files are added directly, with a pull request being created if necessary.
